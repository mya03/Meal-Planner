  1. [Add reports folder and empty files for each member](https://github.com/mya03/Meal-Planner/commit/98ce931a7859f5fa769cec571d5d5dc04b15c3e4): I created a new reports folder to streamline our documentation process. Additionally, I set up empty files for each team member to ensure everyone has a designated space to contribute their reports. This organization will help improve accessibility and collaboration within the team.
  2. [Update roles.md](https://github.com/mya03/Meal-Planner/commit/d66290033ecd1c61588a64c1b4e1342168df8bc0): I created a template for the `roles.md` file, allowing team members to input their specific responsibilities. This template will help standardize the information and make it easier for everyone to contribute and access the details of each role within the team.
  3. [Update features.md](https://github.com/mya03/Meal-Planner/commit/a3f7fb37c2a5b6c1fe55abea2c129654542cf5d9): I took the initiative to write the entire `features.md` file from scratch. This document outlines all the key features of our project, providing a comprehensive overview for the team. Having a complete and detailed features file will help ensure everyone is aligned on the projectâ€™s capabilities and goals.
