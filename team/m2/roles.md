This organization will help improve accessibility and collaboration within the team.
  2. [Update roles.md](https://github.com/mya03/Meal-Planner/commit/d66290033ecd1c61588a64c1b4e1342168df8bc0): I created a template for the `roles.md` file, allowing team members to input their specific responsibilities. This template will help standardize the information and make it easier for everyone to contribute and access the details of each role within the team.

Having a complete and detailed features file will help ensure everyone is aligned on the projectâ€™s capabilities and goals.
