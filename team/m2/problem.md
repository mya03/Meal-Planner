# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

Many people find it challenging to plan their meals effectively while balancing their busy schedules and dietary requirements. With a variety of ingredients at home and leftover ingredients from other meals, it can be difficult for people to create balanced meals that meet their nutritional goals. Moreover, tracking calorie and nutrient intake can be tiresome if there isn't an organized system. While some people use more traditional meal planning methods such as handwritten notes or basic apps, these tools often lack features that help users maximize their available ingredients, manage their dietary goals, and share their own recipes with other users all in one tool.

  house, or ingredients they want to eat.

  users have on hand, minimizing food waste.  
  months.
- **User Profile**: Users can input their weight and height, allowing the 
  website to calculate their Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).
